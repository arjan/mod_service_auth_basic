mod_service_auth_basic
======================

Provide Basic HTTP authentication for Zotonic API calls.

By default, Zotonic ships with OAuth 1.0 authentication for API calls
but for legacy applications it is often easier to implement Basic
Auth. This module hooks into the service authentication system to
provide such username/password authentication for your Zotonic API
routines.
